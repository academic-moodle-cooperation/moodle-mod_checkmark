Description
-----------

The Checkmark module allows teachers to obtain information about the assignments completed by the
students prior to a lesson.


Example
-------

A lecture with 500 students is accompanied by a training session. Teachers publish the assignment
names and the number of achievable points per assignment. Each week the students work on the
assignments and use the checkmark module to inform the teacher in advance about the assignments
that they managed to complete.

In the classroom session where individual students present their solutions, teachers can use a
printed copy of the tabular overview to verify the indicated performance. After the training
session there is the option of automatic grading on the basis of the assignments checked.

------------

The plugin is available for Moodle 2.5+. This version is for Moodle 3.7.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-mod_checkmark/issues). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a
screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
