    In order to add a submission
    As a student
    I need to be able to change the submission and save it.

  Scenario: Add a submission
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 0         |
    And the following "users" exist:

      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
    # We do not need to manually create the checkmark instance again,
    # this has been testet in checkmark_adding.feature, use generators!
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity  | course | idnumber | name        | intro         |
      | checkmark | C1     | CM1      | Checkmark 1 | Description 1 |
    When I am on the "CM1" Activity page logged in as student1
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Example 1 | 1 |
      | Example 2 | 1 |
      | Example 3 | 1 |
      | Example 4 | 1 |
      | Example 5 | 1 |
      | Example 6 | 1 |
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should see "Your changes have been saved"
    And I should see "You've checked 6 out of 10 examples."
    And I should see "(60 out of a maximum of 100 points)"
